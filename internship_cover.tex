I'm interested with an internship position with \company; I've also graduated
from Carnegie Mellon with my B.S. People tell me this is peculiar. The reason is
simple: as my resume shows I've never actually worked outside the
university. It seems wise to take a shorter-term position to see how the world
outside academia is before signing on for the long haul. The usual pay
for an undergrad in school will be quite acceptable.

Ideally being a
\position for \company will turn out to be a good fit, and I can then pursue a
full-time position with you. Whether or not that's true, though, I look forward
to working with \company.
